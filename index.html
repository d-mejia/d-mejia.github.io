<h1>Comet</h1>
<p>I learned the other day that in Spanish<br>
kites are called comets.<br>
Comets are also called comets. It’s the same word: <i>cometa</i>.<br>
I love the imagery of that—<br>
of a little kid going to the beach, unraveling with string,<br>
and flying his own comet like a dog on a leash.<br>
I went to a planetarium show once where they said the star<br>
of Bethlehem that guided the magi to Jesus<br>
probably wasn’t a real star.<br>
They don’t know for sure what it was<br>
but it might’ve been a conjunction,<br>
which is when the path of two planets gets really, really close<br>
and the light that produces<br>
looks as bright as a star in the sky—<br>
and so that’s what they called it.<br>
I love the imagery of that as well and find it very relatable.<br>
For how many times have I looked out at night<br>
searching for a sign from the universe,<br>
desperate for a sign from God?</p>
