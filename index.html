<h1>Comet</h1>
<br>
<p>I learned the other day that in Spanish
kites are called comets.
Comets are also called comets. It’s the same word: cometa.
I love the imagery of that—
of a little kid going to the beach, unraveling with string,
and flying his own comet like a dog on a leash.
I went to a planetarium show once where they said the star
of Bethlehem that guided the magi to Jesus
probably wasn’t a real star.
They don’t know for sure what it was
but it might’ve been a conjunction,
which is when the path of two planets gets really, really close
and the light that produces
looks as bright as a star in the sky—
and so that’s what they called it.
I love the imagery of that as well and find it very relatable.
For how many times have I looked out at night
searching for a sign from the universe,
desperate for a sign from God?</p>
